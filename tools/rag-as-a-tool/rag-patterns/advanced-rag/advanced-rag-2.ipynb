This mechanism is used in both the encoder and decoder of the Transformer model architecture. In the encoder, self-attention layers enable each position to attend to all positions in the previous layer, while in the decoder, each position can attend to all positions up to and including that position. This helps in capturing dependencies within the sequence without relying on recurrence, leading to more efficient and effective sequence modeling. The Multi-Head Attention in Transformers helps counteract the reduced effective resolution caused by averaging attention-weighted positions, enhancing the overall performance of the model.\n","\n","--- End Evaluation ---\n","\n","\n","--- Running RAG without Query Rewriting (for comparison) ---\n","\n","--- RAG Pipeline Evaluation ---\n","Original Query: What is the self-attention mechanism in Transformers?\n","\n","Retrieved and Reranked Documents:\n","Document 1:\n","Content: reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n","to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n","descr...\n","------------------------------\n","Document 2:\n","Content: Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n","The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n","connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, ...\n","------------------------------\n","Document 3:\n","Content: typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n","[38, 2, 9].\n","â¢ The encoder contains self-attention layers.
